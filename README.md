Use Case Driven Approach with JavaScript
========================================

This is an example implementation using the use case driven approach as described by Robert C. Martin in his talk [“Architecture the Lost Years”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkDN78P884) at Ruby Midwest 2011. It tries to use the same naming conventions as mentioned by Martin in his talk except for one difference: Interactors are called UseCases. I’ve implemented the use case “Create Order”, which is shown as an example in Martin’s talk.


Future plans
------------

1. add tests
2. implement the LocalStorage Entity Gateway
3. add second delivery mechanism using require.js
4. add third delivery mechanism using Angular.js
